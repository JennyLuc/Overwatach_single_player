## Questions
I will be forming questions as I work on analyzing this dataset.

### V 1.0 
Goal: Understanding the player
    * Overall player stats for DPS, Healer, and Tank.
    * What character does the player main?
    * What time does the player tend to play?
    * Is there a game pattern that makes the player feel tilted after a game?
    * Were there psychological changes throughout the time?
    * Can we predict when a the player feels through the notes and stats?
